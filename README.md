# SQL Portfolio 🗂️

Welcome to my SQL portfolio! This repository showcases my work with SQLite through various projects, where I’ve applied fundamental and advanced SQL techniques to analyze data and derive insights. Below is a brief description of a few projects and the SQL techniques used. 🚀

## Projects 📊

### 1. **Superstore Inventory & Rating Analysis** 🏪
This SQL analysis explores inventory levels, pricing tiers, and customer satisfaction metrics in a fictional superstore. It simulates how SQL can be used to inform product restocking, pricing strategy, and sales insights.

#### Key SQL Techniques:
- **Aggregate Functions**: Used `SUM()` to calculate total stock available, `MAX()` and `MIN()` for analyzing product ratings and pricing, allowing insights into inventory and sales trends.
- **Filtering**: Applied `WHERE` clauses to isolate products needing replenishment based on stock quantity thresholds, helping to identify which products are understocked.
- **Ordering & Grouping**: Utilized `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY` for sorting data by price and product category, optimizing how data is viewed and interpreted.

### 2. **Baked Goods Inventory Analysis 🍰**
This SQL project analyzes inventory levels for a bakery using basic filtering, sorting, and aggregation logic. It demonstrates how SQL can support daily retail operations through restocking reports and pricing audits.

#### Key SQL Techniques:
- **Data Insertion & Table Design**: Employed `INSERT INTO` for populating the table and defined a table schema with proper data types to ensure integrity.
- **Aggregate Functions**: Used `SUM()` to get the total available stock across all baked goods, providing an overview of inventory levels.
- **Filtering & Sorting**: Applied `WHERE` and `ORDER BY` to focus on specific products needing replenishment and to sort products by price, giving a clearer view of product availability.
- **Conditional Logic**: Applied `CASE` statements to categorize products based on their `Attack` and `Defense` values, enabling a dynamic way to classify product attributes.
